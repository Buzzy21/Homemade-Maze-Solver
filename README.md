# Homemade-Maze-Solver
- Code for a generic maze solver with a generic homemade DFS algorithm.

# Notes:
- THIS IS NOT PRACTICAL. I MADE THIS FOR FUN AND PRACTICE.
- This is not a program that takes user input, this is JUST a generic maze-solving algorithm. The .exe file serves absolutely no purpose but to run the code on a sample maze. 
- For input, EXCLUSIVELY use "#" for walls, and "*" for starting/ending positions (there should always be only two *s).
